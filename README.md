# project-asteroids
HTML5 clone of classic arcade game Asteroids using game engines courtesy of Udacity
I did a version previously in Python, thought it would be fun to port it over.

## TO DO LIST:

 - ~~Initialize README.md~~
 - ~~Render background image~~
 - ~~Build general gameObj Object~~
	- ~~Build Player Object~~
	- ~~Build Asteroids Object~~
	- ~~Build Missile Object~~

###Player
- ~~Render spaceship~~
- ~~Implement movement controls~~
	- ~~Ship should move..like a ship..not like a rook~~
	- ~~Space has no friction...so let's try and simulate that!~~
	- ~~We actually need friction to help improve gameplay!~~ 
	- ~~Ship should be able to wrap around the screen~~

### Missiles
- Implement missile functionality
	- Can have multiple missiles, we should have an array of these objects
	- Missiles should expire
	- Missiles should blow up asteroids
	- Missiles should wrap around the screen
	- Missiles should come from the tip of the ship

###Asteroids
 - ~~Render One Asteroid~~
 - ~~Render multiple asteroids~~
 - ~~Asteroids should have random momentum/movement~~
 	- ~~Asteroids should also be able to wrap around the screen~~
 	- ~~Asteroids should SPIN...this is hard~~
-Option: Asteroids should be able to split into smaller asteroids

#### Collision (probably last to do..)
- must handle collision between ship and rock, rock and missiles...

###Menu
- able to start game when player ready
- able to choose a space ship
- able to restart game
- pause functionality

###Score and Life system
- Keep track of score based on number of asteroids destroyed
- When lives < 0; game-over


## Initialization

To play the game download the zip file or clone my [repo](github.com/shui91/project-asteroids) and initialize the project at index.html.

-- Features to be implemented --
Press space to begin, r to restart.

Use the arrow keys to move the space shuttle, and the space bar to shoot.

Avoid the asteroids and build up your high score!

## Features

A working HTML5 clone of the classic arcade game Asteroids.
